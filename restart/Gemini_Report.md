# Project Restructure & Workflow Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines a refined strategy for your website project, focusing on a seamless and well-documented workflow that integrates Builder.io, Next.js, and Netlify. Your current codebase is a strong starting point, and this plan builds upon it to provide the clarity and efficiency you're looking for.

The core recommendation is to fully embrace a "visual-first" development model with Builder.io at the center of your content strategy. This involves a clear separation of concerns:

*   **Builder.io:** The primary tool for content creation, page building, and visual editing.
*   **Next.js/React:** The foundation for your application, providing the structure, custom components, and data integration.
*   **Netlify:** The platform for continuous integration, deployment, and hosting.
*   **GitHub:** The single source of truth for your codebase.

This approach will empower your team to work in parallel, with content creators and developers each using the best tools for their tasks.

## 2. Core Technologies & Integration

### Next.js

Your Next.js setup is well-configured. The use of the App Router and the `[[...slug]]` dynamic route is the correct approach for a Builder.io-powered site.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Custom Components:** Continue to build out your library of custom React components in the `src/components` directory. These components can be registered in Builder.io to give content creators a rich set of building blocks.
*   **Data Fetching:** For pages that need to fetch data from other sources, continue to use Next.js's data fetching capabilities (server components, `fetch`, etc.). This data can be passed as props to your Builder.io-rendered pages.

### Builder.io

Your existing integration with the Builder.io React SDK is correct. The key to a successful Builder.io workflow is a well-defined content model and a clear understanding of how content is managed.

**Recommendations:**

*   **API Keys:** Ensure your Builder.io API key is stored securely as an environment variable in Netlify. You should have separate keys for your `preview` and `production` environments.
*   **Webhooks:** Configure a webhook in Builder.io to trigger a new build on Netlify whenever content is published. This is crucial for keeping your live site up-to-date.
    *   In your Netlify site settings, go to **Build & deploy > Continuous deployment > Build hooks**.
    *   Create a new build hook and add the URL to your Builder.io model settings under **Webhooks**.
*   **Previewing:** Your `[[...slug]]/page.tsx` file correctly uses `isPreviewing()` to show unpublished content. This is essential for a smooth content creation experience.

### Netlify

Your `netlify.toml` file is correctly configured to build and deploy your Next.js application.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Environment Variables:** Manage all your secret keys and environment-specific settings in the Netlify UI under **Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment**.
*   **Deploy Previews:** Leverage Netlify's deploy previews for every pull request. This allows you to review changes in a production-like environment before merging to your main branch.

## 3. Recommended Workflow

This workflow is designed to be simple, efficient, and predictable.

### Git Branching Model

*   **`main`:** This branch represents your production-ready codebase. It should only be updated by merging from the `preview` branch.
*   **`preview`:** This is your primary integration branch. All new features and bug fixes should be merged into this branch. This branch is automatically deployed to your preview environment on Netlify.
*   **Feature Branches:** Create a new branch for every new feature or bug fix (e.g., `feat/new-component`, `fix/header-bug`). This keeps your work isolated and makes it easy to review.

### Development Workflow

1.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Start by creating a new branch from `preview`.
2.  **Develop Custom Components:** Build new React components in the `src/components` directory.
3.  **Register Components in Builder.io:** In your Builder.io account, register the new components so they can be used by content creators.
4.  **Push and Create a Pull Request:** Once the feature is complete, push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request to merge into `preview`.
5.  **Review and Merge:** The pull request will trigger a deploy preview on Netlify. Once reviewed and approved, merge the pull request.

### Content Workflow

1.  **Create or Edit Content:** Content creators work directly in the Builder.io visual editor.
2.  **Preview Changes:** They can instantly preview their changes on the `preview` version of your site.
3.  **Publish:** When the content is ready, they hit "publish" in Builder.io.
4.  **Automated Deployment:** The Builder.io webhook triggers a new build on Netlify, and the changes are automatically deployed to your production site.

## 4. VS Code Integration

To enhance your development experience in VS Code, consider the following extensions:

*   **ESLint:** Integrates ESLint into your editor to help you catch errors and enforce code style.
*   **Prettier - Code formatter:** Automatically formats your code to ensure consistency.
*   **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense:** Provides intelligent autocompletion for Tailwind CSS classes.
*   **GitLens:** Supercharges the Git capabilities built into VS Code.

## 5. Actionable Next Steps

1.  **Delete the existing repository and create a new one.** This will give you a clean slate and ensure that all the new configurations are applied correctly.
2.  **Initialize a new Next.js project.** Use `npx create-next-app@latest` to create a new project.
3.  **Install the necessary dependencies.** This includes `@builder.io/sdk-react`, `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`, `tailwindcss`, and any other libraries you need.
4.  **Configure your `next.config.ts` and `netlify.toml` files.** Use the configurations from this report as a starting point.
5.  **Set up your Builder.io project.** Create your content models and get your API keys.
6.  **Create the `[[...slug]]/page.tsx` file.** This will be the entry point for your Builder.io content.
7.  **Configure your environment variables in Netlify.**
8.  **Set up your Git branching strategy.**
9.  **Start building your custom components.**

By following this plan, you can create a robust and scalable website that is a pleasure to work on for both developers and content creators.
