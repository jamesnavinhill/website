personal / profressional website:

basic nextjs project created -

hosted on netlify/ thru github / 

mostly static for now - will incorporate more function eventually like embedding my apps, apis, etc. 

clear distinction between server sid and client sid with clear rules

first page welcome placeholder
second page styling guide - with sections to organize fonts, componnents, buttons, etc - our own visual styling representation of our themes, colors, etc. nothin too fancy - just a way for us to keep our styling organized here at first - unless theres betetr ways - packages that do this for us etc.. netlfiy visual editor has some nice function, but we want it closer to us in code so we can see and test chsnges in real-time 

initial setup should focus on the foundations - rules - typesaftey - setting uo and configuring the project and making sure all is flush and sorte before doing any design

look up the nextjs netlify integrations - they cover a lot of the backend work - but lets assure were complimenting and filling in any gaps without redundancy - netlify has a good nextjs media optimization system, cahcing etc. so no need to build these ourselves unless we run into specific issues

for srtyling - ill want to test  few different packs - material, shadcn, tailwindcss etc so ill be creating a few branches from main - one for preview - and a couple for A/B testing different features or themes. ill need to assure hat these always stay updated in the rpoepr way, e.g when i make changes to main, regardless of where they come from- whther a push from preview, or a push from A/B to preview to main, they should all synch accordingly so thst they cath up to main and can be iterated again but not be behind -

ill also want to setup the github actions - and some dependabot, automATION FLOWS FOR WEHN I SUBMIT CHANGES ETC.. BUT THIS CAN WAIT UNTIL WEVE ESTABLISHED OUR SITE IS WORKING AND AT A DECENT PLACE TO GO LIVE

will be a creative feeling website - open space - interactivce - will start from a view of space.. and immersive scroll feeling as you zoom into the galaxy, then down through clouds, into earths atmosphere, down above map view, down to tree level, underground view, roots growing down as we scroll, down into the crust and mantle, back to outterspace galaxy view at the end.. 

will have the following sections: *NOT READY TO BE CREATED OR EVEN SCAFFOLED YET- ONLY LANDING PAGE(WELCOME ONLY) and the STYLE GUIDE pages will be created at first - ill dial in the styling page before adding real pages with any design or code bitu the rest fo the major pages planned so far:
landing page with slick scroll animations
about me / site explaining my idea behind domain names - digitial future - my story
passions / projects - charity work, personal projects
professional / work - real work history, resume
artist / art-music,design,image,videos - music player, image gallery, inspo gallery
gamer / gaming dev, - resources, links
developer / development - links, resources
Thinker / blog - longform, research topics
Resourceful / resources - goodies
Community / contact - links, contacts, community boards
still workign on the way ill order, name, etc this is just for reference. many design/layout decisions will evolve
