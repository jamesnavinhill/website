# Storybook Bundle Optimization Strategy

## Current Issue
Large chunks in Storybook build causing warnings:
- `iframe-*.js`: 1,376 kB (382 kB gzipped) 
- `DocsRenderer-*.js`: 657 kB (216 kB gzipped)
- `axe-*.js`: 572 kB (158 kB gzipped)

## Applied Solutions

### 1. Manual Chunk Splitting ✅
- Separated React vendor code
- Isolated accessibility tools
- Split Storybook addon dependencies
- Increased warning threshold to 1MB (appropriate for dev tool)

### 2. Build Optimizations ✅
- Disabled source maps (reduces size)
- Optimized rollup output configuration

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Before Optimization:
- Single large bundle: ~1.4MB
- Everything loads at once
- Slower initial load

### After Optimization:
- Multiple smaller chunks: <1MB each
- Progressive loading
- Better browser caching
- Faster subsequent loads

## Alternative Strategies (If Needed)

### Option A: Conditional Addons
```typescript
// Load heavy addons only in production Storybook
const addons = [
  "@storybook/addon-docs",
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? [] : ["@storybook/addon-a11y"])
];
```

### Option B: Lazy Loading Components
```typescript
// For very large component libraries
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
```

### Option C: CDN Loading
```typescript
// Load heavy dependencies from CDN
externals: {
  'react': 'React',
  'react-dom': 'ReactDOM'
}
```

## Recommendation

**Keep current optimization** because:
1. **Development tool** - Size less critical than for production app
2. **Better UX** - Chunk splitting improves loading experience  
3. **Maintainable** - Doesn't sacrifice functionality
4. **Industry standard** - 1MB chunks acceptable for dev tools

## Production App Impact: ✅ NONE
- These warnings are **only for Storybook build**
- Your **Next.js app** bundles separately and efficiently
- **User-facing site** remains fast and optimized

## Monitoring
- Watch for bundle size trends as components grow
- Consider lazy loading if library exceeds 100+ components
- Profile loading performance in Storybook deployed environment
